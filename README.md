# Handwritten-digit-recognition-MNIST-dataset-
This project implements handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset using Fast KNN (implemented from scratch), Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees. The models are evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, and misclassified sample analysis, with dimensionality reduction via PCA and a voting ensemble for improved performance.
